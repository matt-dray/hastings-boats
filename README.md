Under construction: explore the Hastings fishing boat database. You can [view online the (in-development) interactive table](https://matt-dray.github.io/hastings-boats/).

The [Hastings Fishermen's Museum](http://www.ohps.org.uk/hastings-fishermans-museum/) hosts a physical copy of the town's fishing-boat database. The purpose of this repo is to tidy the data and present it for people to more explore it more easily.

The database was collated by Steve Peak as a supplement to his book [*Fishermen of Hastings*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fishermen-Hastings-Steve-Peak/dp/B0054WJXN4).
