A Shiny app for the Hastings fishing boat database

# TL;DR

The [Hastings Fishermen's Museum](http://www.ohps.org.uk/hastings-fishermans-museum/) hosts a physical copy of a fishing boat dataset. I aim to clean the data and make it more accesisble via an [R Shiny app](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/).
