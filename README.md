# hastings-boats
A Shiny app for the Hastings fishing boat database

:construction: Under development :construction:

# TL;DR

The [Hastings Fishermen's Museum](http://www.ohps.org.uk/hastings-fishermans-museum/) hosts a physical copy of a fishing boat dataset. I aim to clean the data and make it more accesisble via an [R Shiny app](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/).

# Live web app

The app is hosted with shinyapps.io: [https://mattdray.shinyapps.io/hastings-boats/](https://mattdray.shinyapps.io/hastings-boats/)

Note that the app will fail to load if the monthly active hours limit (25) has been exceeded.

# Attribution

The data were collected originally by Steve Peak as a supplement to his book [*Fishermen of Hastings*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fishermen-Hastings-Steve-Peak/dp/B0054WJXN4). The data are not yet available from this repository.
